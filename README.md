# Find a Coach App with Vue
 A  project which uses core features of vue with guide of Max Schwarzm√ºller's Vue course
 
I mostly done this project myself but i changed my code for making it looking similar to original code. It uses core vue features like  vuex, routers, transitions, slots etc. I am also using firebase as database, users should change database link to theirs in firebase.js.

For installing simply use npm install and npm run serve in terminal
