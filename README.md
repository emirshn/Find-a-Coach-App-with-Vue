 A  project which uses core features of vue with guide of Max Schwarzmüller's Vue course
 
I mostly done this project myself but i changed my code for making it looking similar to original code. It uses core vue features like  vuex, routers, transitions, slots etc.

For installing simply use npm install and npm run serve
