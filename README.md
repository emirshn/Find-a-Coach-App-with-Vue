# Find a Coach App with Vue
 A  project which uses core features of vue with guide of Max Schwarzm√ºller's Vue course
 
I mostly done this project myself but i changed my code for making it looking similar to original code. It uses core vue features like  vuex, routers, transitions, slots etc. I am also using firebase as database, users should change database link to theirs in firebase.js. Currently there is no auth logic it only displays fixed coach's requests and because of that new registers are blocked. I will update after i learn authentication.

For installing simply use npm install and npm run serve in terminal
